WSE e2e Automation Test Usage Guidelines 

1. Understanding Automation Test Purpose:
•	Familiarize yourself with the primary goal of automation testing, which is to ensure the consistent functionality and reliability of WSE audio and camera effects across various settings
•	Understand that automation tests are designed specifically to confirm that WSE effects remain functional even under challenging conditions.

2. Access Control:
•	Ensure that access to automation test scripts, tools, and results is restricted to authorized personnel only and is not to be shared further.
•	Grant appropriate permissions based on team members' roles and responsibilities. 
•	Limit the sharing of the logger tool to maintain security.
 
3. Test Environment Setup:
•	Set up the test environment with a stable network and dedicated Wi-Fi (for Smart Plug setup). 
•	Configure the smart plug to execute automation tests with the device both plugged in and unplugged. 
•	Arrange posters or mannequins with human faces to activate auto-framing animations.
•	Conduct automation tests in a controlled manner to minimize any potential impact on the application or its surroundings.
 
4. Test Execution Guidelines:
•	Keep the device updated with the latest firmware and install the WSE under test. 
•	Conduct a manual Sanity test: Camera app and Setting app page opens maximized, ensure the ability to toggle WSE effects (both audio and video) in the settings page and perform audio and video recordings.
